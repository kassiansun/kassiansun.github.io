The reason for choosing bash is its ubiquity. Most desktop \u0026 server Linux distributions and Docker images will ship with bash, which makes it a great fit for a configure-once-use-everywhere development environment. So you write it once and copy it to every host you’ll write code on. But since ~2014 my bash configuration has degraded several times, for two major reasons:\n To support different host environments, from Arch Linux to WSL to Cygwin to Mac OS To support different terminal environments, from XShell/iTerm to putty to the serial console The need for “use-everywhere” decreased my coding productivity for the most time and made the configuration harder and harder to maintain.  Since 2019 I’ve been a heavy user of Macbook, mainly because every company ships Macbook for programmers by default. My personal machine was always XPS13, hosting a Windows + Hyper-V + ArchLinux environment, and using a standard bash environment on ArchLinux, ssh-ed with XShell. The pros of this configuration:\n Arch Linux is the most easy-to-use distribution, with rolling updates and a simple packaging strategy. XShell provides a decent good terminal experience. Windows is the most widespread desktop operating system.  The cons are quite obvious: it’s hard to configure and hard to port, you need to bring up a brand-new Arch Linux virtual machine on every new host (the development environment is too big to copy and paste).\nOn the other hand, Mac OS ships with a shell environment by default, and everything in it is Unix-like. Along with homebrew, the command line environment feels good enough, although not comparable with the pureness of Arch Linux. The hardware of Mac OS was always a pain point, but not anymore with the M1 chip. Earlier this year I purchased an M1 Macbook, after daily usages of more than half a year, I decided to boost my productivity on Mac OS to maximum, which means the productivity on command line.\nThe good parts of oh-my-zsh and why it was successful I’ve heard of oh-my-zsh for several years, although zsh is not a ubiquity shell, but since I’ve decided to give up on the “use-everywhere” feature, it’s not a problem everywhere. After one-week experience with oh-my-zsh, there’re several points I’ve noticed:\n The basic shell support is similar, which makes porting the old .bash_profile very easy. The default configuration of oh-my-zsh is good enough, so I don’t have to worry about the initial learning curve. The ecosystem (mainly plugins) was a key to success. The vi-mode plugin works great, as a heavy user of vim, this boosts my keystrokes a lot. Support django by default, and I’m learning it to build a backend API server for my personal project. History is across different terminals, especially useful as I’m always using a lot of tabs for different purposes.  All of these advantages make oh-my-zsh a safe suggestion for newbie programmers. It’s neither exotic nor bizarre, it’s a decent good starting point and everything you learned with it will be useful later.\nSome pain points as a former bash user  git plugin shiped by default pollutes the command line with a super long list of git shortcuts, as a heavy user of .gitconfig, it’s useless and confusing. git has a default integration with oh-my-zsh, you need to turn it off. First noticed this when I cd into the WebKit repository and zsh were stuck on it. The completion doesn’t always work, many packages don’t ship with zsh completion by default. The tab behavior feels very different from bash, I’m still getting used to it. History across terminals is good, but also a bit confusing when I stoke up and see something unexpected.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <code>bash</code> as the development environment for a long time. The reason for choosing <code>bash</code> is its ubiquity.
Most desktop & server Linux distributions and Docker images will ship with bash, which makes it a great fit for a
configure-once-use-everywhere development environment. So you write it once and copy it to every host you&rsquo;ll write
code on. But since ~2014 my bash configuration has degraded several times, for two major reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To support different host environments, from Arch Linux to WSL to Cygwin to Mac OS</li>
<li>To support different terminal environments, from XShell/iTerm to putty to the serial console
The need for &ldquo;use-everywhere&rdquo; decreased my coding productivity for the most time and made the configuration
harder and harder to maintain.</li>
