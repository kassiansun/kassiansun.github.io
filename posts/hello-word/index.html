That will be a complete guide on a specific area, based on what I’ve learned during my career \u0026 life. I once wrote something on the web, before 2019, but then realized that they are a bit too childish and immature. The last three years were very important for me, by writing notes and structuring them, and repeating this cycle, some clear ideas are growing in my mind. Maybe soon I’ll be confident enough to write them down and share them with everyone else.\n","wordCount":"352","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-11-22T11:03:54+08:00","dateModified":"2021-11-22T11:03:54+08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.kassiansun.com/posts/hello-word/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Kassian Sun","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.kassiansun.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.kassiansun.com/ accesskey=h title="Kassian Sun (Alt + H)">Kassian Sun</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.kassiansun.com/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Hello Word</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-11-22 11:03:54 +0800 +0800'>November 22, 2021</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Yes, this is my first post.</p><p>Recently I&rsquo;m reading &lt;Own Your Tech Career>, the idea of the book is great.
