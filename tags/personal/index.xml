Recently I&amp;rsquo;m reading &amp;lt;Own Your Tech Career&amp;gt;, the idea of the book is great. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t know the author personally, we share many same thoughts on technology, career, and life. The most important thing I learned is how to get engaged in communities &amp;amp; build a personal brand. One thing is writing personal blogs, so here it is.
To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t create this website by blindly following another guy&amp;rsquo;s idea.</description></item></channel></rss>
