### Tech Stack

Programming Languages

- **Go** - My go-to backend programming language. I enjoy the simplicity of Go and its design around backend development. Not interested in using Go for frontend/GUI/embedded/data analysis, etc.
- **Python** - I use Python as major data analysis language. Two companion languages are SQL and R, my path to the solution is always SQL -> Python -> R. Not very interested in Python backend programming -- I don't like dynamic language at backend side.
- **TypeScript** - It's difficult to maintain a large scale project without type annotations, so I avoid using JavaScript in any serious project.
- **Rust** - My favorite programming language. Maybe one day rust will become the go-to language for backend programming. Currently using rust to write the backend for my personal project.
- **C/C++** - I don't write C/C++ but read & learn C/C++ source codes.
- **SQL** - I use SQL whenever it's possible.

DevOps

- **Redis** - In-memory & persisted data structure storage.
- **PostgreSQL** - My favorite database, read the source code occasionally.
- **Nginx** - Service gateway, also a great implementation reference of the HTTP spec.
- **Unix Environment** - I would've said Arch Linux, but I don't use Linux as my personal development environment anymore. Currently I'm trying to build a degraded Arch Linux on top of Mac OS X.
- **Ansible** - I use ansible as a declaritive replacement for Bash, not perfect but robust enough to build an infrastructure from scratch.
- **Kubernetes** - Huge system based on simple design, my favorite way of architecting large-scale systems.

Web

I like web technologies, they're built upon openminded and collaborative guys. Personally I use React and TypeScript, but can also enjoy coding with Vue and JavaScript.

### Tooling Stack

- Zotero - My personal knowledge base.
- Obsidian - I use Obsidian to store all Zettelkasten notes.
- Procreate - Free-style notes.

### Hobbies

- Fitness & Running - To maintain my physical energy.
- Sketching - To improve my handwriting and diagramming skills.
- Reading - Mainly about psychology, sociology and anthropology, sometime philosophy, linguistics and history.
