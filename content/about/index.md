### Tech Stack

- Go - My go-to backend programming language. I enjoy the simplicity of Go and its design around backend development. Not interested in using Go for frontend/GUI/embedded/data analysis, etc.
- Python - I use Python as major data analysis language. Two companion languages are SQL and R, my path to the solution is always SQL -> Python -> R. Not very interested in Python backend programming -- I don't like dynamic language at backend side.
- TypeScript - It's difficult to maintain a large scale project without type annotations, so I avoid using JavaScript in any serious project.
- Rust - My favorite programming language. Maybe one day rust will become the go-to language for backend programming. Currently using rust to write the backend for my personal project.
- PostgreSQL - My favorite database, read the source code occasionally.
- Web - I like web technologies, they're built upon openminded and collaborative guys. Personally I use React and TypeScript, but can also enjoy coding with Vue and JavaScript.
- Ansible - I use ansible as a declaritive replacement for Bash, not perfect but robust enough to build an infrastructure from scratch.
- Kubernetes - Huge system based on simple design, my favorite way of architecting large-scale systems.
- \*nix - I would've said Arch Linux, but I don't use Linux as my personal development environment anymore. Currently I'm trying to build a degraded Arch Linux on top of Mac OS X.

### Tooling Stack

- OneNote - My knowledge base.
- Muse - Semi-structured notes.
- Procreate - Free-style notes.
- Streaks - Schedules trivial & non-trivial daily routines.

### Hobbies

- Fitness & Running - To maintain my physical energy.
- Sketching - To improve my handwriting and diagramming skills.
- Reading - Mainly about psychology, sociology and anthropology, sometime philosophy and history.
