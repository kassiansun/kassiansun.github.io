Yes, this is my first post.

Recently I'm reading \<Own Your Tech Career\>, the idea of the book is great.
Although I don't know the author personally, we share many same thoughts on technology, career, and life.
The most important thing I learned is how to get engaged in communities & build a personal brand. One thing is
writing personal blogs, so here it is.

To be honest, I didn't create this website by blindly following another guy's idea. Since 2019, I've been busy
writing a lot of notes & diaries on OneNote. The goal of OneNote is to build a personal knowledge network, so
it will be easier for me to handle the flood of information and make better decisions. The OneNote focuses on
"core" technologies and interesting "residuals", then the first issue arises: what about those not-that-interesting
stuff? How to tune a specific Nginx configuration, how to write a correct layout in CSS, and some trivial issues
while learning some new technologies (Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, Rust, Erlang, Haskell, etc.).

The answer inspired by the book is to write a blog and share the learning process with people around the world. They
might be trivial, naive, and cheap, but it might help someone else struggling on Google searching for a good answer.
So instead of struggling with the question "This is too trivial why should I put it in OneNote?", writing them here
as blogs will be easier for me. At least, "it might help someone" is a great excitation for the lazy and picky me.

Ultimately, I will try to move some of my OneNote here. That will be a complete guide on a specific area, based on
what I've learned during my career & life. I once wrote something on the web, before 2019, but then realized that they
are a bit too childish and immature. The last three years were very important for me, by writing notes and structuring
them, and repeating this cycle, some clear ideas are growing in my mind. Maybe soon I'll be confident
enough to write them down and share them with everyone else.
