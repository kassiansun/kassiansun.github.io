It has been more than 3 years (!) since I wrote the [initial blog](/posts/hello-world/), so many things
have changed now. One of my initial motivations is that "I need a place to hold all those non-that-interesting
stuffs", but now I've switch to Zotero, and this becomes a non-issue, Zotero is perfect tool to organize all
pieces into a single place.

So what now then? I guess I don't need to drain my energy to read all those boring Go source to code just to
keep my "promise" that I started a series, and it's time to write something really matters to me and that I want
to share with others. They don't have to be "cool", or "correct", or "matters to others", they're just some pieces
of thought.

And I won't use Grammarly anymore, although it was a cool tool, but I guess in this LLM era, focusing on some
trivial things that LLM can easily master and fix for you is stupid. Also there's no point worrying others nitpicking
these writings, even though there might be some people reading them, what matters is to bring my thoughts to people
who might find them interesting, instead of trying to persuate or even attract everyone.

Honestly, I'm jealous of those guy who can extend some trivial discoveries into comprehensive blogs, I find it really
boring to guess all those other people might be ignorant with, find a source for each sentence and paste it in the blog.
This is necessary for scientific writings, but
what most people shared are so trivial. And nowadays we have ChatGPT-like tools, I guess no one will bother digging
through a lengthy blog just to find some steps to follow to solve a specific problem.

Nowadays most people don't even bother reading anymore, so what's the point of writing (and of course reading)?
It's about the meaning, ultimately, we're just some moving creatures that interact with the world, then why
not spend more time on yourself? Read those you like, write those you share, human are social animals and this is
the exact reason we developed languages. We didn't develop it to speak laws or philosophy, we did develop it to
speak ourselves.
